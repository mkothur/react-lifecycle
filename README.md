# react-lifecycle methods

```
React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death.

```

Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events. I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.

- ** Mounting ** – Birth of your component
- ** Update ** – Growth of your component
- ** Unmount ** – Death of your component
